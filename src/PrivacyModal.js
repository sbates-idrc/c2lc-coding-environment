                            At Weavly, we believe that privacy is a fundamental human right, and acknowledge how important
                            it is to our community—especially with regards to both children and parents.
                        </p>
                        <p>This page explains:</p>

                        <h5>Use of cookies for web analytics</h5>

                        <p>We use a web analytics application called "Matomo" to help us
                        understand how many people are using Weavly, approximately where they
                        are located, and what types of devices they are using Weavly on.</p>

                        <p>When you use Weavly, we create cookies that record the following
                        information:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>A random unique identifier used to distinguish one user's device
                            from another (so that we don't count someone's device more than
                            once, or count different devices as one device)</li>
                            <li>If you started Weavly by clicking on a link, then we record the
                            location of the webpage that the link was on</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>When you first load Weavly, we record an anonymized version of your IP
                        address (with the last 2 parts, of 4, removed). For example, if your IP
                        address was 1.2.3.4, we would store 1.2.0.0. We use this anonymized version
                        of the IP address to look up an approximate location, so that we can
                        understand where Weavly is being used.</p>

                        <p>When you go to a website, your browser sends information about itself
                        and the operating system that you are using. We record this information to
                        understand which types of devices Weavly is being used on.</p>

                        <p>We do not track what you are doing in Weavly or collect your personal
                        information.</p>

                        <h5>What information does Weavly store?</h5>

                        <p>
                            As you use Weavly, we may store information on how Weavly is accessed and used by you. We store
                            the following information independently on every browser/device pair that you use Weavly on:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Your prefered settings for display colour theme and keyboard shortcuts</li>
                            <li>Your visible set of action blocks on the action panel</li>
                            <li>Your selected background for the scene</li>
                            <li>Your created program</li>
                            <li>Any line that is drawn on the scene as a result of running your program</li>
                            <li>The last position of your character on the scene</li>
                            <li>The starting position of your character</li>
                            <li>If you dismiss the cookie notification, we record that you
                                dismissed it and Weavly won't show it to you again</li>
                            <li>The version of Weavly that was used</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            You can delete any information that Weavly has generated from your usage by clearing your
                            browser's cache and local storage. Check your browser's documentation for details.
                        </p>

                        <h5>How does Weavly use this information?</h5>

                        <p>
                            The generated information is kept in a local storage on your device to make your use of Weavly
                            more convenient:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Your settings for the coding environment are stored so you don't have to adjust them every
                                time you launch Weavly
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you happen to accidentally or intentionally close your browser, the coding environment
                                will be the same as when you left it for the next time you launch Weavly
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Although storing your information in the browser makes it convenient
                            for every time you access Weavly, it may cause problems on shared computers. As a result,
                            someone that uses the computer after you may be able to access your Weavly settings and program.
                        </p>

                        <h5>How do we keep your information safe?</h5>

                        <p>The security of your data is important to us, but please keep in mind that no method of
                            electronic storage is 100% secure. We currently use browser local storage to store the specified
                            data. The information is stored in the browser by domain (create.weavly.org) and only code
                            running from that domain may access it. Thus, other websites cannot access the data. However,
                            local storage is not encrypted on disk and someone with access to the device could get access to
                            the data.</p>

                        <h5>Children's Privacy</h5>

                        <p>
                            We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18.
                            If you are a parent or guardian and you have become aware that we have collected Personal Data
                            from your children without verification of parental consent, we can take steps to remove that
                            information from our servers. Please <a href="https://weavly.org/about/" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>contact us</a>.
