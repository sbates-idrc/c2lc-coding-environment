# Contributing to the C2LC coding environment

## How We Work

We use [rooms on Matrix.org](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Matrix+Channel)
to communicate as a team. The first step in contributing should be to introduce
yourself and discuss what you have in mind to do.

We use [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
to review proposed changes to our codebase. These are submitted from an
individual's fork of our main repository and compared with a particular
development branch that corresponds to an upcoming release. The rough process is
as follows:

1. Discuss the issue with the team.
2. Check with the team to see which development branch you should work with.
3. If [a JIRA ticket](https://issues.fluidproject.org/projects/C2LC/issues) does
   not already exist for the issue, please create one. Make sure to use the
   version agreed on above as the "fix version".
4. If you have not already done so, fork our main repository.
5. If you are working with an existing fork, make sure your copy of the
   development branch is up-to-date.
6. Create a named branch that corresponds to the JIRA ticket you are working to
   address, i.e. `C2LC-#`
7. Each commit message that you submit against your branch should begin with the
   issue number, and use singular present tense. For example, "C2LC-30: Update
   the README to include more information about how to contribute".
8. Before submitting a pull requests, please make sure all static type checks
   and test cases (see below) are passing.
9. When your work is ready for review, submit a pull request against the desired
   development branch.
10. Your work will automatically be tested by our Continuous Integration. Please
    review and work to address any errors reported.
11. Your work will be reviewed and commented upon and you and the reviewer will
    discuss and agree on what (if anything) needs to be done before the work can
    be accepted.
12. Once the work and related discussion are complete, an accepted change is
    merged with the development branch.

For more details about the technologies used and the standards for an acceptable
pull request, please read on.

## Accessibility

Accessibility is an important part of our project, and all work submitted
against our repository is expected to preserve or improve the level of
accessibility of the project.

If you have any questions about accessibility, please feel free to ask
questions. The [W3C's WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
are a good place to start learning about accessibility on the web.

## Technologies and Coding Conventions Used

### React

The coding environment is written using [React](https://reactjs.org). Here are a
few guidelines regarding how we prefer to work with React:

- Initialise instance properties in the constructor.
- Use [prototype method syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Prototype_methods)
  for class methods.
- Use public class field syntax for React event handlers:
  - [Handling Events (React documentation)](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
  - [Event Handling for React (Flow documentation)](https://flow.org/en/docs/react/events/)
  - [Ecma TC39 "Class field declarations for JavaScript" proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields)
- Provide dependencies to an object instance via constructor parameters.
- Prefer single quotes for string literals.
- Organize CSS by React component, storing the CSS for a component in a file
  named `ComponentName.css` or `ComponentName.scss` (for example
  `ShareButton.css`) (see below).
- Use [BEM](http://getbem.com/) (Block Element Modifier) to name and structure
  CSS styles (see below).

In addition, here are the naming conventions we use:

- JavaScript classes: UpperCamelCase
- Flow types: UpperCamelCase
- Methods and Functions: lowerCamelCase
- Event handlers begin with "handle" (for example `handleClick`)
- Event emitters begin with "on" (for example `onClick={this.handleClick}`)

#### Example

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './ClickCounter.css';

type ClickCounterProps = {
    timesClicked: number,
    onClick: () => void
};

export default class ClickCounter extends React.Component<ClickCounterProps, {}> {
    render() {
        return (
            <button onClick={this.props.onClick}>
                {timesClicked}
            </button>
        );
    }
};
```

As you can see in the above example, we prefer to have [state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
managed "top-down". Presumably there is some overarching component (in our case,
usually `App.js`) that:

1. Tracks a variable that will be used to control the component's look or
   behaviour.
2. Passes a handler to the component to allow it to relay changes.

A simpler example of an "overarching" component might look like:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import ClickCounter from './ClickCounter.js';

type TopDownManagerState = {
    firstComponentClicks: number,
    secondCompnentClicks: number
};

class TopDownManager extends React.Component<{}, TopDownManagerState> {
    constructor (props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            firstComponentClicks: 0,
            secondCompnentClicks: 0
        };
    }

    handleFirstComponentClick = (Event: event) => {
        this.setState((state, props) => {
            return {
                firstComponentClick: state.firstComponentClicks + 1
            }
        });
    }

    handleSecondComponentClick = (Event: event) => {
        this.setState((state, props) => {
            return {
                secondComponentClick: state.secondComponentClicks + 1
            }
        });
    }

    render() {
        return(<React.Fragment>
            <ClickCounter timesClicked={this.state.firstComponentClicks} onClick={this.handleFirstComponentClick}>
            <ClickCounter timesClicked={this.state.secondComponentClicks} onClick={this.handleSecondComponentClick}>
        </React.Fragment>);
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(<TopDownManager />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

When a state variable is updated, react knows to re-render any components that
use that value as a property. In this way we keep UI components simple and
consolidate the logic regarding variables. The above example also illustrates
how we often use react's `setState` method to safely perform updates based on
the current value of a state variable.

### Linting

Where possible, code conventions are enforced by running ESLint. Many of the
rules we use are inherited from [a common configuration for React apps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-react-app).
Additional rules can be found in our [`package.json` file](../package.json).

You can check your work in progress against our coding conventions using the
command:

```shell
npx eslint .
```

Although our conventions are open for discussion, in general you should strive
to ensure that your work passes ESLint checks before submitting your pull
request.

## Static Type Checking

We are using [Flow](https://flow.org/) as our static type checker. Contributions
are expected to include Flow type annotations and to ensure that both the type
checks and type coverage checks pass. You can run the type checks using the
command:

```shell
npx flow
```

We use a package called `flow-coverage-report` to test how much of our work
includes type annotations. To see the current level of coverage (and confirm
whether your changes meet our coverage threshold), you can use the command:

```shell
npx flow-coverage-report --config .flowcoverage-main-threshold
```

If you need to add types for libraries or other content, see
[our Flow typing document](flow-typing.md)

## Writing Tests

Changes to this project are expected to be accompanied by tests, ideally that
demonstrate that the change works as expected. Our tests are written in [Jest](https://jestjs.io)
and [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/). The tests for a given
component should match the component's name, so tests for `MyClass.js` would be
stored in `MyClass.test.js`.

Tests can be run using the command:

```shell
npm test
```

To check that your work in progress meets our standards for test code coverage,
you can use the command:

```shell
npm test -- --watchAll --coverage
```

As there are some things that are difficult to test, these guidelines are
flexible and open for discussion as part of a pull request review.

## Internationalisation

We use [react-intl](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/) to support presenting
our work in multiple languages. We store messages in [`messages.json`](../src/messages.json)
and reference their "message key" in our code.

### Testing with Enzyme and react-intl

Components that present textual content to users have to be tested in a
slightly different fashion than components that do not make use of react-intl.
This section of the document describes how to write tests for internationalised
components.

Enzyme offers a few means of testing components, so we provide examples for both
"shallow" and DOM rendering (aka "mount").

#### Shallow Rendering

When `injectIntl` is used, render `ComponentUnderTest.WrappedComponent` with an
`intl` prop:

```javascript
import { createIntl } from 'react-intl';

const intl = createIntl({
    locale,
    defaultLocale,
    messages
});

const wrapper = shallow(
    <ComponentUnderTest.WrappedComponent
        intl={intl} />
);
```

Otherwise, render `ComponentUnderTest` directly:

```javascript
const wrapper = shallow(
    <ComponentUnderTest />
);
```

#### DOM Rendering

Render `ComponentUnderTest` with an `IntlProvider` `wrappingComponent`:

```javascript
import { IntlProvider } from 'react-intl';

const wrapper = mount(
    <ComponentUnderTest />,
    {
        wrappingComponent: IntlProvider,
        wrappingComponentProps: {
            locale,
            defaultLocale,
            messages
        }
    }
);
```
