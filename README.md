# Weavly

Weavly is a new educational coding tool designed for learners with
disabilities. It can be used with a mouse, touchscreen, or keyboard,
and supports assistive technologies such as screen readers. It is a web
application that works in a browser.

## Installation for Developers

Running this project requires [npm and Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
Many of the scripts used in Weavly require npx, which is included with
npm 5.2.0 or higher. Once you download or fork the source code, you will need to
install the required dependencies using the command:

```shell
npm install
```

## Start the application

To start the app in development mode, use the command:

```shell
npm start
```

A URL like [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) will be displayed in
the console output, open that URL with a browser to see Weavly
in action. The browser window will reload if you add or change files. You will
also see any errors in the console (see [our Contributor's guide for details](./docs/contributing.md)).

## Testing

To run the tests for this project, use the command:

```shell
